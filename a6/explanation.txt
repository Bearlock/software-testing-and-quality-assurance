Allpairs produces a set of test cases that guarantee that each value of each parameter is paired in at least one case. 
Instead of providing each combination (which can get prohibitively large) it pares down the tests cases to a minimum viable set. 
The first part of the output is the test cases, the 'parirings' column shows the number of unique pairings found; the second part shows how pairings were done.
